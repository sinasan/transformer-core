# Model Specification and Technical Implementation

## Model Definition

We are creating a small model that recognizes whether simple sentences are logically correct or incorrect.

Examples:
- ✅ Logically correct:
  - "Birds fly"
  - "Fish swim"
- ❌ Logically incorrect:
  - "All animals fly" (not correct)

## Sample Dataset

| Sentence | Label (1 = logical, 0 = not logical) |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Birds fly | 1 |
| Fish swim | 1 |
| Elephants walk | 1 |
| Stones sleep | 0 |
| Trees swim | 0 |
| All animals fly | 0 |

(This small dataset serves as an example – for a realistic model, you would need more examples.)

## Model Architecture Overview

The transformer-based model comprises three components:

1. **Embedding Layer**:
   - Words are converted into numerical embeddings (learns semantics automatically).

2. **Transformer Encoder**:
   - Understands context and recognizes logical relationships in the sentence through self-attention.

3. **Classification Layer**:
   - Produces a binary output: "logical" or "not logical".

## Technical Implementation (Detailed Steps)

### Step 1 – Preparation
- Prepare Python environment, install PyTorch.

### Step 2 – Define and Prepare Dataset
- Create CSV file or list with sentences and labels.
- Tokenize sentences (separate words).
- Create a small vocabulary (word → index).

### Step 3 – Create Embedding Layer
- PyTorch embedding layer (e.g., dimension = 16 or 32).

### Step 4 – Implement Transformer Encoder
- Multihead self-attention layer + feedforward network.
- Position encodings for the order of words.

### Step 5 – Add Classification Layer
- Pooling (average of token embeddings or special classification token).
- Linear layer for binary decision.

### Step 6 – Training and Evaluation
- Loss function (CrossEntropy) and optimizer (Adam).
- Training loop and accuracy measurement.
